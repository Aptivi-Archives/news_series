Merlin.Speak "The netbook is plugged into the wall, battery removed and turned on. The blue power light on the switch comes on, a gentle hum starts, power and Wi-Fi lights flick on, Then nothing."
Merlin.Speak "No post, no fan and no HDD light."
Merlin.Speak "Also the power button doesn't always start the netbook, but when it does it is stable."
Set Req = Merlin.Speak("The same happens with battery in, however the battery light flashes red as well. The battery does charge (to begin with the netbook wouldn't start at all with the battery in and then after a while it does but the red flashing light remains)")

Merlin.Speak "When he try to use it, it freezes up with a tiny bit of graphics at the top of the screen. He can not boot to safe mode because it locks on amdagp.sys. It will also lock on safemode /network and command prompt in the same place."
Merlin.Speak "Last known configuration only shows the Windows logo screen with the status bar moving but it never boots. This is also what happens on the normal boot."
Set Req = Merlin.Speak("If he tried to use the recovery console, he gets 'disk read error occured press Control+Alt+DeleteFile to restart.'")

Merlin.Speak "He have an Asus EEE PC1005PEB which, the other day, suddenly turned off. He was using it while the battery was being charged. Then, he tried removing it and leaving only the power cord connected, but nothing happened. There is no sign of life, no lights on. Nothing. He didn't smell burning either."
Merlin.Speak "He tested the power supply and the readings were correct (19V with no load), disassembled the netbook, disconnected everything (WiFi, HD chord,etc) but still it wouldn't turn on."
Merlin.Speak "Finally, something strange happened. He thought the DC IN jack might be the problem (the model has 4 pins soldered to the board)."
Merlin.Speak "While he was doing some tests, he happened to plug the power adapter and a few times he noticed some sparks coming from the inside of the female jack. He realised the male plug (the one coming from the power source) suffered minor burns, nothing big."
Set Req = Merlin.Speak("Anyway, tested it again(no load) and everything was fine. He tried to measure the voltage right on the weldings that held the female jack to the board. The multimeter kept showing nothing but 0V. If he is not wrong, the 4 pins are grounded except from the positive one.")

Merlin.Speak "The only exception to this is when the battery is removed and the laptop is plugged into the mains in which the same thing happens but the battery indicator does not light up because there is no battery plugged in"
Merlin.Speak "Another thing worth noting is that the the fan inside intermittently spins while plugged into the mains. While all lights are flashing the fan will spin for less than a second not even making a full rotation stop for less than a second and repeat. This has led him to believe that the netbook is trying to boot without him pressing any buttons."
