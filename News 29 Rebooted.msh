Birdie.Speak "In GTA Vice City, if you fail the Bloodring when you run out of time, you will not actually die in the Bloodring. After you exit the stadium event, then the effect of the dying carries over outside in the Downtown area - so if you die, you are transported back to the stadium with all your weapons. Also, this glitch may actually change your existing clothes back to street clothes."
Birdie.Speak "Another reason for this is because the stadium events is just like any ordinary mission. If you get 'mission failed', you will not die. As for the stadiums, you can die as well get mission failed. So after dying outside of the stadium events, the death sequence that was supposed to happen at the stadium, will occur in Vice City instead. Try to die, and the game will spawn you in front of Hyman Stadium."
Birdie.Speak "This glitch also happens because of the message 'Mission failed'. If you were to fail the Bloodring, the game brings this message up in Vice City and a conflict will occur if you try to die since normally when you get mission failed, the game thinks you died as well."

Birdie.Speak "He originally had the power saving settings set to turn the monitor off after 5 minutes and put the computer to sleep after 20. After the monitor turns off, the HD light shows the HD is being accessed heavily."
Birdie.Speak "But after a few minutes the light stops flickering and just stays on constantly. If he jiggle the mouse to turn the monitor back on, the screen is either blank or frozen, the mouse cursor is the spinning wheel for a while (I can move it around but that's all), he can't start Task Manager or anything, and then he get a BSOD."

After the booting process started, it would show a black screen with 'Boot from CD/DVD: ' 'Disk boot failure: Insert system disk and press Enter'. Pressing the power button on the case turned the computer off immediately, and when he turned it back on, Windows booted normally."
Birdie.Speak "After this happened three times, he found out that you could disable automatic restarts on BSOD and did so. The next two times the computer crashed like this, the error messages were KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR and CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (that's all - no numbers or file names or anything)."
Birdie.Speak "It says 'collecting some error info', but stays at 0% completion with the HDD light still on constantly. He allowed it to stay that way for a few minutes, then pressed the power button and the computer turned off immediately. When he turned it on again after that, Windows again booted normally (this time without the system trying to boot from a disk like it did before he disabled automatic restarts)."
