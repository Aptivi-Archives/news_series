Birdie.Speak "Once the PC has shutdown, the fans will spin, but the PC does nothing. After turning the PC off by holding down the power button, he turn it back on, only to find the fans spin, but nothing happens. (Hard drive, DVD Drive, graphics card, etcetera do not do anything)."
Birdie.Speak "The confusing part is, if he leaves the PC alone for a few hours, and turn it back on, the BIOS appears, resets everything, and works again, until the next BSOD."
Birdie.Speak "He highly doubt this is a PSU problem, as he used to have a GTS250 1GB running on it, but that randomly stopped working completely."

Birdie.Speak "He did some research in various threads and most of them pointed to faulty RAM or even faulty slots."

Birdie.Speak "Just to be on the safe side he bought an additional kit and tested the stability of the PC. It did fine for about half an hour but eventually it went into a BSOD loop again, then he updated his Motherboard BIOS to no avail."
Birdie.Speak "At this point, he suspected a driver issue but he's not an expert on driver utilities so the easier way for him to discard this would be to wipe the SSD and install Windows again."
Birdie.Speak "Using a CD the process ran fine up until 49% when it crashed yet again, making it impossible to finish the installation as it booted into the same error message that he had to restart in order to continue."

Birdie.Speak "Using disk management, he quick-formatted the SDD and installed Windows normally with zero problems."

Birdie.Speak "So he replaced the Molex-to-SATA and SATA cables, and he had a spare internal hard drive laying around."
Birdie.Speak "The spare internal HD had problems before (CrystalDiskInfo gave it a 'Caution' indicator), and he later learned that it was probably because the fan in front of it was too dusty."
Birdie.Speak "So after removing the drive, he had it sitting on a table for a few weeks. And now, he used it to replace the HD with the black powder underneath it. He immediately tested it in CrystalDiskInfo, which said it was 'Good' now, perhaps because there was no more dust problems."
Birdie.Speak "After the new internal HD was running in the computer for a few hours, it suddenly blue screened with a\Map=""Kernel Data In Page Error,""=""'KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR',""\usually indicating a problem reading from the hard drive. And now he couldn't read it from after testing it on another computer, so it was definitely dead."

Birdie.Speak "When he press the restart button, the computer does not restart immediately but continues with the frozen screen and looping sound for about 5 seconds then the computer shuts down completely and after 5 seconds it powers on by itself!!!!!!"
Birdie.Speak "The computer does not only freeze when using an operating system. It freezes during the BIOS as well sometimes, requiring hard restart and restarts the same way."
Birdie.Speak "Memtest found errors in one stick after 4 hours of testing, but the problem persisted even without that stick."
Birdie.Speak "He has tested the other stick for 4 hours and it had no errors and also Memtest freezes."
Birdie.Speak "The time will freeze, the test will stop progressing and the only thing changing is the blinking red plus in the top left corner. Everything else is frozen. This requires a restart."
Birdie.Speak "About 4 months ago, there was a blackout in his street, and his PSU exploded."
Birdie.Speak "He doesn't remember the brand but he knows that it was a 500W PSU. The tech from the PC store installed a new Codegen 450W PSU."
Birdie.Speak "The problems started about 3-4 weeks after that."
Birdie.Speak "He tried to solve the freezing problem on his own for almost 4 months but he couldn't do it, so he gave his PC to the tech support guys."
Birdie.Speak "After a week of testing they couldn't figure out the problem (they said they needed more time), but he had to take it back because he has some projects to do until the beginning of June."

Birdie.Speak "Then, he realized his WindowBlinds wouldn't load so he set it back to normal Windows XP theme."
Birdie.Speak "Then, he looked at the time and it reads 9/13/2003. This obviously means that the computer forgot the time so the 'failing CMOS battery' lit up in his head."
