Birdie.Speak "His PSU still works, and he narrowed the problem down to his motherboard. He took it out to inspect it, and there is a small missing chunk from what he presume to be the Ethernet controller. Nothing else seems to be blown."
Set Req = Birdie.Speak("The modem still works, and he was connected via Ethernet. Everything is connected to a surge protector, except of course the cable for his modem that goes into the wall.")

Birdie.Speak "So he thinks his computer just blew up. Or, some of it. He was playing Heroes of the Storm and suddenly all of his monitors went black, and he could hear his PC turning off."
Birdie.Speak "He thought that maybe he hit a cable with his foot or his screen driver crashed."
Birdie.Speak "He looked down to the left under his table towards his PC and he can see that there's a small 'fireish' colour behind it! To be more precise, the fireish colour was directly behind my PSU, and he had a very small like explosion! Then it stopped and all of the lights in his room and the WiFi stopped working."
Birdie.Speak "He thinks he overloaded his wall plug somehow."
Birdie.Speak "He plugged his two screens of the extension chord and a small lamp. Then he was able to get the power back on in his room, but his PC can't boot."
Birdie.Speak "There's no lights in his PC when there is power connected to it. He can't see on the PSU if something looks fried or not."
Birdie.Speak "He bought a Corsair AX 860 today and installed it in his computer. He plugged his screen and PSU into a single wall plug, so he wouldn't run into any problems."
Birdie.Speak "Once it was setup up, he powered up the PSU and all of the correct lights in the case lit up."
Birdie.Speak "He turned on the computer and it turned on like nothing had happened! It only made to the Windows 8 loading screen when the screen began to go from a black screen to kind of like a grey screen very fast!"
Birdie.Speak "He thought that maybe his OS had corrupted once the old PSU blew up. He then remembered that he forgot to install the SLI bridge, but that couldn't have an effect on that, but he tried anyways."
Set Req = Birdie.Speak("He installed the bridge and then the computer turned on like nothing had happened! His computer detects both SSD's, both GPU's, CPU and Motherboard and all fans are spinning.")

Birdie.Speak "He recently had an Antec TPQ-1000watt PSU fry on him during a gaming session. It sizzled, sparks, popped! Then the system shut down."
Birdie.Speak "So he got a new EVGA 1000watt Gold PSU, hooked it all up, system turns on, all fans, even GPU fans run, lights etc, but he gets no video signal at all, not even a monitor 'flash' or anything. He doesn't even get a POST beep."
Birdie.Speak "It went out with a bang! Never seen that happen before and visually everything looks good, but nothing works."
Birdie.Speak "He even took the PSU apart and doesn't see any blown capacitors."
Set Req = Birdie.Speak("He did install a Corsair H80i liquid cpu cooler about 2 weeks prior to this, and the pump and fan power on the cooling unit run off SATA power connector, so he used a free end.")

Birdie.Speak "After taking his computer outside and cleaning it out with a compressed air can, he took it back inside and turned it on."
Birdie.Speak "When he pressed the on switch it instantly made a fairly loud bang or pop sound and smelt like burning although he did not see any smoke!"
Birdie.Speak "When cleaning he used only short bursts and kept the can upright at all times so he doesn't think at least any liquid came out."
Set Req = Birdie.Speak("He unplugged it and the smell was coming from the PSU which it was makes him suspect it. The dust build up was fairly a lot due to 3 years of no cleaning.")

Birdie.Speak "He went ahead and installed the new card and turned on his PC and still no luck. He couldn't install any new drivers or anything. He didn't bother to go into the BIOS since he figured it's no use."

Birdie.Speak "So he was taking his PC apart for christmas to put in a new CPU and motherboard. However when he took the whole thing apart, he realized he got scammed for the CPU."
Birdie.Speak "He started to put his PC back together and wait for a refund to get a new CPU. He put it back together and upon starting up it was extremely slow, like took 5-10 mins just to switch. Then when it came on, it would work for a few minutes then Windows would crash and his screen would freeze."
Birdie.Speak "He switched off his PC and checked all the connections weren't loose then tried again but it kept happening. He eventually got a message upon start up saying disk read error occurred, so he took out his hard drives and put them back in"
Birdie.Speak "This time it started but Windows crashed again. He tried one more time but left the side panel off and watched it as it switched on."

Birdie.Speak "So after assembling it back, everything looked pretty good except the fact that a few screws were left unused."
Birdie.Speak "He plugged in the charger and the power LED turned on. When he tried to boot it, the fan started spinning and everything seemed normal but then his socket started crackling!"
