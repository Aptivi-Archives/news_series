Genie.Speak "He has an old PC which he use for gaming. He opened up the case the other day to put in a new soundcard and noticed that a lot of the capacitors had been leaking, or looked like they were about to leak."
Genie.Speak "He did a bit of reading online and found out that it's a fairly common issue with older PCs, and that if you know what you are doing it's easy to replace them."
Genie.Speak "He went to the only local computer repair shop and asked if they would do it. They said they would do it, for about £45 (which seemed a bit much to me, but not over the top), but they recommended that he left it as the computer was still working, and it might not work after they had replaced them."

Genie.Speak "His power supply on his less than one week old computer just died and leaked some stinky brown ooze onto his floor."
Genie.Speak "He had some electricians working on my powerbox. He shut down his computer but he didn’t unplug it from the UPS. He came back to his desk after they finish up what they were doing and he notice a powerful smell."
Genie.Speak "He try to turn on his computer and it won’t turn on. The power button lights for a fraction of a second and the case fans start up and then stop and startup and stop."
Genie.Speak "Flip the switch on and on with no luck, move the case so he can look at the back and notice a tablespoon of brown ooze on the floor trickling out from the bottom of the powersupply."
Genie.Speak "Obviously, the powersupply is dead, but now he's worried that he have 1500 dollars of new PC parts that just died with it. Nothing really looks burned. There is still a faint smell in the case after he removed the PSU but he doesn’t know if that is lingering odor from the burn or it it means the components are dead."

Genie.Speak "Recently for unknown reasons his monitor has started making a static/white noise with occasional outbursts of ear splitting crackling."
Genie.Speak "Interestingly enough, the monitor is silent when not connected to the computer and even during startup until the Windows 8 login page appears."
Genie.Speak "He has attached a video to illustrate this. (Notice that there is no static or noise until the moment the login appears. That's when you'll hear the outburst.)"
Genie.Speak "The static sound is also registered in his volume control area. Whenever it makes a noise, the green bar jumps a little bit. When he's not doing anything at the computer, it makes small little static 'ticks' that last half a second."
Genie.Speak "However, when he's doing things like opening a file, or loading a webpage, it seems more prone to these really violent outburst of crackling static."
Set Req = Genie.Speak("He's tried switching out the HDMI and no luck there. He also thought it might be that his volume control is too high but he has always kept his monitor volume set to about 30/100 and controlled the volume with the windows volume controller.")

He can get it to work, but at the moment, the only way to do so is by repetitively powering up and removing/reinserting the battery to try to boot it up again. Its only a year and a half old but he's dropped it from a car seat out onto the pavement a month or two ago.")

Genie.Speak "A few months down the road he noticed that when he turned on the monitor he would hear this loud 'Pop!' noise as it powered up. The picture looked fine."
Genie.Speak "Finally the other day he turned it on, heard two loud pops!, and the screen is blank. Now when he turn it on he hear it make some sort of undulating hissing sound for a few seconds, like a car trying to start, before it just gives up."
Set Req = Genie.Speak("Interestingly, he noticed when looking through the air vents with the lights out there is some sort of blue sparking action going on in the back of the monitor.")
