Birdie.Speak "His main concern is that this thing is overloading the PSU by drawing more than 700W, because it appears to only do this when both the CPU and GPU are running close to 100% for a while. He has it running at 4.2 GHz now and appears to be fine (It survived an overnight BOINC session as well as 4 hours of Planetside 2), but if all it took was 100 MHz to set it off he's a little concerned."

Birdie.Speak "He transferred everything over, and tried to boot several times. Each time, it would stay on for the same amount of time and then power off... about 3-5 seconds."
Birdie.Speak "He realized he forgot to hook up the mobo speaker. So he did that, and he realized that it was actually getting to POST, and then shutting off immediately after one short beep. However he never got any video on screen."
Birdie.Speak "Upon closer examination, it turns out he did forget to hook up the Molex power connector to the Radeon 9700 Pro. He forgot that such an old card needed to draw power from the power supply. So thinking he may have found the problem, he hook that up, and he boot the computer."
Birdie.Speak "This time, it doesn't even stay on for mroe than a split second. He also hear a spark sound, and think he smell a slight burn. He examine everything, don't see anything, and his girlfriend convinces him it was in his head because she's cooking and that could be what he's smelling."
Birdie.Speak "Either way, now the computer isn't really turning on at all. No fans. Just a faint light coming from the power button when he have it in the 'on' position."
Birdie.Speak "Now he think it's probably time to troubleshoot the power supply. He has an old crappy power supply that came with a case he bought that he never used sitting in the closet. So he take out the Thermaltake, and put in this crappy looking 500W Raidmax power supply."
Birdie.Speak "The computer isn't on for more than an instant when he see some smoke that seems to be coming from the video card. He can't remember if he shut the computer off right away out of panic or if it shut off itself; either way, it wasn't on for long. He has never seen anything like that happen."
Birdie.Speak "Je examine the video card, he examine the AGP slot and the mobo around that, everything looks fine, no burns or anything."
Birdie.Speak "He take the video card out and leave it out, he then intended to test the motherboard as advised on this forum, by removing the RAM and booting to see if he get the expected beep codes. Since the video card was (presumably) just smoking, he take that out as well."

As soon as he booted up and ran the PC for a hour or so no problems with the video. Tried using different HDMI cables no change. He wasn't able to get the screen corruption to replicate."

Birdie.Speak "There is a server that he joined in March 2014. That was the date before we came. It's probably the best server until December 2015."
Birdie.Speak "A new player joined, but he was too polite to other players and staff. He decided to get him started to let him use his blaze farm and automatic melon farm."
Birdie.Speak "He also made him occupy a part of the base, since the owner didn't need it, and he made him maxed out diamond armor and tools like swords, etc."
Birdie.Speak "They started building together."
Birdie.Speak "Everything was fine, until another guy joined, when he started OK at first, then he got more belligerent as he is buying perks and making donations to all of the staff members to get players away from the server."
Birdie.Speak "Let's call the player that's telling the story, X, the nice guy, Y, and the bad guy, Z."
Birdie.Speak "Z repeatedly messaged X telling him to stop complaining about him being rude to players to the staff members so X want him to be banned."
Birdie.Speak "It continued to be like this in a very unusable situation until April 2016, where the server admins have announced that the staff applications were open."
Birdie.Speak "X and Y tried to apply for staff, but X didn't get staff because he wasn't accepted, while Y got staff."
Birdie.Speak "X was waiting for a year to get staff, but he was disappointed to see that he failed to get it applied, so he was partying for Y."
Birdie.Speak "This was the funniest thing X has ever done. A lot of fireworks, explosions, potions, etc."
Birdie.Speak "Now, the rude Z applied as well and got moderator instead of being rejected and banned. Unexpected."
Birdie.Speak "In his records, he got records and instances of swearing, griefing, and being rude. He was constantly telling anyone to stop complaining whenever it happened."
Birdie.Speak "X had a clean record, and is very nice to other players, and so, the community."
Birdie.Speak "However, something seems to be getting out of control because Z has to punish all players who had clean records since the server has started and who did not even break the rules, at all."
Birdie.Speak "They tried to ask for their offenses to remove, but the owner 'trusts Z's decisions and will not be removed.'"
Birdie.Speak "Z then starts to warn X over things like flattening land, making buildings that are too fancy, and making redstone lighting."
Birdie.Speak "After a few months, he was banned over griefing, when he isn't doing it. He went on the forums to make a dispute, and they said that Z had banned him."
Birdie.Speak "Z has posted the screenshots of X griefing the building, which is untrue because he is destructive, because he modified the history to make it look like that X is griefing the building."
Birdie.Speak "He failed to ask questions, because the staff had to lock the thread before even answering."
Birdie.Speak "He asked Y to investigate, and he checked the ticket and took more screenshots of the area that he 'griefed' in."
Birdie.Speak "The moderator, Z, had griefed the building but instead of admitting, he tried to edit a history entry for that area so it would look like that X griefed everything."
Birdie.Speak "Y had said it from what I have said in the last statement, but X was surprised that one of the areas that he 'griefed' was the house that one of his friends owned."
Birdie.Speak "He started the thread on the forum that Z needs to be demoted to normal member with a permanent ban...... It got locked and deleted before anyone can see it!"
Birdie.Speak "He contacted the server owner, for which we'll be calling, A, and told him about everything that a moderator has done. However, he failed to reply, because 'he trusts Z.'"
Birdie.Speak "Z then goes very rude and tell all of the other staff members that haven't seen X that he is a griefer, and they just accepted without evidence and started to ban him like 20 times for the corrupted reasons that are very mean, rude, and offensive."
Birdie.Speak "'Bye zFa!!!! We won't miss you!'"
Birdie.Speak "'Wow, it's so great to be rid of you!'"
Birdie.Speak "'You are a horrible person and should never have ever been allowed on this server in the first place. We are so much better than you.'"
Birdie.Speak "Then they banned him on their own servers before he can even contact them to tell them that none of these are true, because they're using MCBans, which is terrible, and that Z has told them not to allow him on all their own servers. As a result, he can't join most servers because he had a horrible rating on it, and he lost the projects that took months to finish on that server."
Birdie.Speak "And now the second story."
Birdie.Speak "\Spd=75\This is the last story of all News."
Birdie.Speak "Let's call the one who is telling the story, X, and the rogue owner, Y"
Birdie.Speak "He remember a friend of his's had a 12-player whitelist survival server with a few addons."
Birdie.Speak "They had so much fun even if the map resets every now and then. But a hacker came, with an Xray hack, who managed to find so many diamonds."
Birdie.Speak "But the original server owner is in the high school and so he shut it down because he can't keep up for hackers and tricksters."
Birdie.Speak "After a few months, a rogue owner stole the address and made the server where it has a 40 player limitation, and the server title is 'Welcome back.'"
Birdie.Speak "X told his friends and they started doing everything they are supposed to do, until they made a Nether portal and went inside."
Birdie.Speak "They failed to find the nether fortress where it is guarded by blazes and zombie pigmen, so they went back to the Overworld to find that they're going to the shallow grassy valley, in which they have climbed up the hill and saw the nice-looking wooden or cobblestone buildings with iron stuff behind it."
Birdie.Speak "In the gravel roads, they have labels. However this is built in survival, so they realized that Y has took over the entire server."
Birdie.Speak "They found valuable stuff like diamond blocks and beacons carefully without damaging the buildings so they wouldn't realize something is up with the admins that are actively looking for corruption in the town. They went back home."
Birdie.Speak "A few weeks later, when the admins were extensively guarding the town and restoring what was damaged, X and his friends tried to find a nether fortress in which they returned to a valley because they failed to find the fortress."
Birdie.Speak "They noticed that there was a wall that is put by the admins telling strangers to go away. They bypassed the wall and started to steal everything, in which the admins replied with the thicker and taller wall with signs that got more worried. They are starting to do town raiding parties every few weeks so that admins there think that there are ghosts in the town stealing stuff."
Birdie.Speak "The admins, as expected, thought that the ghosts had came back to seek revenge on him. He didn't know that X and his friends were actively using the nether portal in which brang them to the valley. The admins can't use the portals for that reason either."
Birdie.Speak "The admins then exposed them and banned them for 'HAHA gotcha but well played.'"
Birdie.Speak "They were disappointed... Someone unbanned X only, with administrative privileges without even touching the town. He unbanned his friends and they all continued as usual."
Birdie.Speak "The admins thought that they are scared because the raids are continuing, so they put the sign saying that has to be stopped. They thought that it was ghosts."
Birdie.Speak "In the final days, the message was 'You win now leave me alone!' After that, the server got brutally shut down with the raided town."
Birdie.Speak "This is the goodbye music for News 30. For programmers that can change the value, please change the directory to your own music. It should be saves as Wave format. (.wav)"
Birdie.Speak "Goodbye News series", "C:\Documents and Settings\EoflaOE\My Documents\title.wav"
Birdie.Speak "However we're still not done yet, because we kept making amusements, programming, and some games that you may find at https://eofla.wordpress.com. Also, we have created a fake radio station of GTA San Andreas named Eofla Radio."
Birdie.Speak "Goodbye."
