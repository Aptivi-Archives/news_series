Birdie.Speak "OK, easy enough. He did some searching and the solution is to go into BIOS/UEFI to update the Secure Boot parameters."
Birdie.Speak "He rebooted the system, and it said press F2 or DEL to enter BIOS."
Birdie.Speak "When he went to BIOS, it enters into the UEFI Module, but there is no information displayed, and the keyboard and mouse do not appear to work!"

Birdie.Speak "So after that he read that the GPU does not sync with the monitor and displays wrong resolution, so he tried three different Video Cards that have several different inputs. These included HDMI, DVI, & VGA."
Birdie.Speak "He tried several different monitors, which included 3x ASUS 27', ViewSonic, and a Flat Screen LED TV. He tried straight cables and he tried adapters."
Birdie.Speak "He still kept getting the same BIOS/UEFI screen. So next he read that the USB Mouse/Keyboard could be the culprit, so he tried an adapted USB to PS2 Wired Keyboard in its place."
