Birdie.Speak "So it did the partitioning and he selected the reboot option in CWM. It showed that it's rebooting. He went to grab a snack at the kitchen."
Birdie.Speak "When he came back to his room... The 'Rebooting' text was still on the screen!"
Birdie.Speak "So he used the combination of Volume Up + Power button + Home button. (He thought that was the combination to restart the phone, just like to enter recovery). The phone turned off, as usual."
Birdie.Speak "When he tried to reboot, the phone never turned back on!!!"
Birdie.Speak "So he was pretty sure he failed after trying everything except the stuff with his pc. But as he connected his phone to the PC, he heard device connection sound."

Birdie.Speak "Next, his phone is filed not as a phone or something else but as a Broadcom USB Wireless Modem."
Birdie.Speak "Another catch is that Odin 1.85 and 1.87 detects his phone! but Odin 3.xx doesn't. He tried flashing his bricked S5300 with both working Odin versions, but it always stops in connection setup... (The phone appears as a yellow rectangle on Odin)."

Recharging to 100% will allow normal operation, but reboot cycle will start again [without any warning] when battery level drops.

Birdie.Speak "So today he was watching some videos, minding his own business, when he got an email. It was an email from an unknown person sending him a minecraft.jar."
Birdie.Speak "He decided to download it, to see what that is. He scanned it 5 times, backed up his worlds and old jar and put it in the bin folder."
Birdie.Speak "He run it and the Mojang logo doesn't come up. It jumps straight to the main menu."
Birdie.Speak "The version said Minecraft 6.6.6 which creeped me out a little, but he continued. The minecraft logo and background were messed up, looked corrupted or something."
Birdie.Speak "There were only 3 buttons: Play, Options and Escape. He instantly thought this is some sort of cracked/ripped minecraft, so he pressed play."
Birdie.Speak "He was greeted by the world selection screen and he clicked 'New', which probably meant a new world. There were only 3 Options: World name, New and Cancel. I left the world name as it is and created it."
Birdie.Speak "While creating the world, the game simply showed: 'Loading... There is no turning back'."
Birdie.Speak "What followed shocked him, he spawned and the world generation is really weird and random, also it was very dark."
Birdie.Speak "He tried to play with the brightness but nothing worked, also there was no sun, or moon."
Birdie.Speak "The HUD was all distorted and there was no in-game sound."
Birdie.Speak "He tried quitting but it wouldn't work so he walked around for few minutes in the dark, until he gets attacked by like 10 zombies at once."

Birdie.Speak "He studied long and hard on how to make one, and then he got to work. He opened his C++ Editor, and began coding in the changes. He then added a new bootscreen, Microsoft Office 2010, WindowBlinds and various other things."
Birdie.Speak "When it was ready, he named it as Windows XP Second Edition. He was so proud of his lovely operating system."
Birdie.Speak "He had even installed the Update Hack from POSReady 2009. He was ready to go!"
Birdie.Speak "After a day of working on assignments and fine-tuning the operating system, he went to sleep, looking forward to using my OS again. However, when he woke up and booted up the computer, something was wrong."
Birdie.Speak "The bootscreen he made now looked like it had been made in Paint! The text was in Comic Sans! The Windows Logo looked like it had been made by a child who was using a laptop touchpad!"
Birdie.Speak "He thought someone had modified his OS, so he checked everything when the system booted up. Nothing was different."
Birdie.Speak "He decided to shut his computer off, and leave it alone for the rest of the day. However when he arrived home, he noticed a massive 'X' drawn across the front of his house in green and red paint that blended together to form a faecal brown!"
Birdie.Speak "When he entered the house, everything was a mess! Dishes and cutlery were strewn across the floor! His dinner table had been flipped over! The kingsize bed looked as if it had been slept in! Its covers had been tossed across the room! His toilet was missing its handle!! Its seat had been cracked by something heavy!!!"
Birdie.Speak "At last, he entered the room where his computer was. Strangely, the machine had been left relatively untouched, but its screen was flickering every now and then."
Birdie.Speak "He switched the screen off and on again, and what he saw horrified him in every way!"
Birdie.Speak "He murmured as he looked at the warped and distorted screen. There was no loading bar, and the screen hung for a moment, before continuing to flicker with static until it suddenly shut off again, smoke gushing from its ports!"
Birdie.Speak "The Operating system booted up to the welcome screen. His icons was replaced with horrifying looks."
Birdie.Speak "His computer automatically logged in, and everything seemed to be wrong."
Birdie.Speak "The entire desktop was a deep crimson, and fluid dripped down the screen! He felt as if he could touch it and get blood on his hand! The red cleared."
Birdie.Speak "At once, the command prompt appeared. It was completely blank, save for the command line. Text began to flicker over the screen."
Birdie.Speak "He tried to press the power button, but nothing happened."
Birdie.Speak "The speakers began to surge and crackle, sounding almost like a baritone laugh."
Birdie.Speak "The last thing he saw was a blinding light, and then everything went dark."

Birdie.Speak "The hacker said hi at first and acted all nice until the hacker started breaking his friend's base and he banned the hacker. He then somehow later was on the world but wasn't logged on any part of the server and was invisible!"
Birdie.Speak "Ever since he closed his server and got a new IP for it months later, the same issue with the guy keeps happening."
Birdie.Speak "He knew it was him because he got this in his server log:"
Birdie.Speak "[Server thread/Error]: Couldn't save chunk; net.minecraft.world.MinecraftException: The save is being accessed from another location, aborting"
Birdie.Speak "He got this message on his console after his friend and him found a structure in their world that had a trap in it."
Birdie.Speak "He fell and died and there was a sign at the top of the structure"
Birdie.Speak "But on his end, he wasn't able to see the sign, and only his friend could."
Birdie.Speak "He later restarted the server, and the structure was gone"
Birdie.Speak "He thinks the reason for this could be that the server didn't save after he started taking over the server."
Birdie.Speak "He also didn't have time to check the signs in NBT or MCedit. But thank's to his friend they have a picture of it."
Birdie.Speak "His friend reported today also about getting effected with poison, blindness, and instant damage with no potion splash or effect."
Birdie.Speak "However, they have both witnessed random boss titles on their screen. (like Ender Dragon, Wither) and worst of all; invisible particle effects floating around sometimes."
Birdie.Speak "He has banned the guy and he has remained banned permanently. Just a little later.... They got more signs like so."
